# Player-Data-Python
Taking a two csv files containing NBA and NFL player data and performing certain actions such as extracting, altering, and ordering. This is a re-do of a project I completed in my cosc 220 class, which is taught in c++. The goal is to increase my python knowledge by completing this project again in python.
